# HOTHIV2018
Our project from Hack on the Hill IV, February 17, 2018.
 Our project is designed to provide background music to solo artists. Our website records solo artists singing, and sends back a track with an added percussion track and harmonies. For this project, our team won the award “Best Web Hack”.
